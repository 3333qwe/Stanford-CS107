Welcome to the Multithreaded CS107 RSS Search Engine!


This handy tool pulls and processes a huge number of RSS (Rich Site Summary) pages, 
and then allows for a simple search of those documents.  Each document is downloaded
in its own thread to vastly decrease the time to create the article database compared
to sequential processing in one thread.
